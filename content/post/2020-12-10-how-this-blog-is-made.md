# Introduction

Resently I wanted to try out CloudFlare for web hosting.  They just released their new analytics platform to the free teir of their software.  I've been using AWS CloudFront and S3 buckets to host my static site, but it was slightly complicated to setup and I wanted to see what else was out there.  So I've decided to try out CloudFlare.

# Hugo

I use the static site generator called [Hugo](gohugo.io).  Here's marketing from their website. 



The world's fastest framework for building websites

Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.

I've been a fan of Hugo because it makes generating a static site very simple, even for someone like me who does not focus on the web development side of things.  Previously I tried using Jekyll, but struggled getting Ruby up and running on my windows machine, but Hugo works like a charm since it's just a executable with no dependencies.
