My name is Jonathan Hamberg.  I am currently working at Jeeva Wireless as a Firmware Engineer.  I just graduated with my Bachelors from Electrical Engineering department at the University of Washington.

I hope to provide some insightful articles about embedded programming, shell scripts, and anything else that I find interesting.
